# stats507-coursework
STATS507 is a course that surveys the software tools that are currently popular among data scientists in academia and industry. The course begins with basic Python programming before proceeding to Python's scientific computing stack. Finally, the course is completed after an introduction to deep learning using PyTorch.

The purpose of this repository is to store all of my completed work for this course.
